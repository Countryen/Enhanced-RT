# Enhanced RT

## Description
Enhancements for the Rooster Teeth website.

### Features

#### Recently Added Episode Grid with Filters
Enhanced RT creates a [Recently Added page](https://roosterteeth.com/episode/recently-added) that allows you to view the most recent episodes from all channels on one convenient page. Episodes on this page can be filtered by channel so that you only see episodes from the channels you want to see. The episodes on this page are organized into a vertical grid that you can quickly scroll through. When you scroll down to the end of the page there is a **Show More** button that will allow you to load more episodes. Enhanced RT also gives you an easy way to get to this Recently Added page by clicking on the heading titled **RECENT VIDEOS** on the [Rooster Teeth home page](https://roosterteeth.com/).

#### Video Timestamps
Some commenters use timestamps to reference a specific moment in a video that they are commenting about. Normally if you want to see what they are talking about you need to scroll up and manually move the video slider to the correct time yourself. Enhanced RT converts these timestamps into clickable links. When you click on one of these links the video will automatically jump to that time and start playing from there. Timestamps must be written in HH:MM:SS format to be detected correctly. Specifying hours is optional.
